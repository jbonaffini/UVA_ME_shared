  - Reproduction of [figure 3](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=large&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007266.g003) from the scientific article [Reduced model to predict thrombin and fibrin during thrombosis on collagen/tissue factor under venous flow: Roles of γ’-fibrin and factor XIa](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007266) from the [PLOS Journal](https://www.plos.org/) of [Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/)

Shared code for [STAT 5630 Statistical Machine Learning Final Project](https://github.com/jbonaffini/UVA_ME_shared/tree/master/STAT5630_Project)

  -  Analysis of the Opioid Epidemic from the perpective of prescribers
  -  Data is initially from [U.S. Opiate Prescriptions/Overdoses on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions), was downloaded from [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Site, CY 2014](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/PartD2017), and processed by Dr. Alan Pryor.
  -  I, along with my team, performed further processing and applied machine learning techniques with the goal of finding the impact of presecription drugs upon drug-related deaths in the United States.

## Standards
All files are to contain no spaces, just use underscores
    
  - For example: instead of 
  
      ```"my file.txt"```
      
    use 
    
      ```"my_file.txt"```

All variables are to be lowercase, separated by underscores (not camel case) or periods (in R) 

  -  For example: instead of 
  
      ```"my var" or "myVar```
      
     use 
    
      ```"my_var"```
      
 All variables are to be descriptive

  -  For example: instead of 
  
      ```"model"```
      
     use 
    
      ```"linear_reg_model"```
